# Contributing to Unity Pomodoro
ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

### How to Start
- Please see our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) prior to contribution.
- The best way to start contributing is to open a line of dialog in our [discussions page](https://github.com/adrian-miasik/unity-pomodoro/discussions). I'm asking contributors to come forward with a discussion prior to doing any work if the intent is to merge into this repo. Though any PR's are appreciated. Otherwise, fork away and modify for your own personal use. :)
  - In the discussions page you can propose ideas, pull requests, and discuss how you'd like to help out. Even fixing typos is highly appreciated.
  - Once your contribution is accepted and merged we will modify the credits bubble to include your github name and link if you'd like.
